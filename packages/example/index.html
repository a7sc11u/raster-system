						A group of five selfish underachievers co-own a decrepit Irish bar
						and are constantly involved in various controversies.
					</p>
					<p class="sans-400 type-1/3 md:type-2/4 lg:type-4/5 measure-9">
						Each member of "The Gang" displays unethical behavior and traits
						such as excessive drinking and drug abuse, dishonesty and egotism.
						Episodes usually find them hatching elaborate schemes and often
						conspiring against one another and others for personal gain,
						vengeance, or simply the entertainment of watching another's
						downfall. They habitually inflict mental, emotional, and physical
						pain on each other and anyone who crosses their path. They also
						regularly use blackmail to manipulate one another and others outside
						of the group.
					</p>
					<p class="sans-400 type-1/3 md:type-2/4 lg:type-4/5 measure-9">
						The Gang's unity is never solid, and any of them will quickly dump
						any of the others for quick profit or personal gain regardless of
						the consequences. Despite this, they ultimately return to their
						usual group dynamic due to their toxic codependency. Everything they
						do results in contention among themselves, and much of the show's
						dialogue involves the characters arguing or yelling at one another.
						Despite their lack of success or achievements, they maintain high
						opinions of themselves and display an obsessive interest in their
						reputations and public images.

					<h1>It's Always Sunny<br />in Philadelphia</h1>

				<section class="article-content">
					<p>
						A group of five selfish underachievers co-own a decrepit Irish bar and are constantly involved in various
						controversies.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each member of "The Gang" displays unethical behavior and traits such as excessive drinking and drug abuse,
						dishonesty and egotism. Episodes usually find them hatching elaborate schemes and often conspiring against
						one another and others for personal gain, vengeance, or simply the entertainment of watching another's
						downfall. They habitually inflict mental, emotional, and physical pain on each other and anyone who crosses
						their path. They also regularly use blackmail to manipulate one another and others outside of the group.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Gang's unity is never solid, and any of them will quickly dump any of the others for quick profit or
						personal gain regardless of the consequences. Despite this, they ultimately return to their usual group
						dynamic due to their toxic codependency. Everything they do results in contention among themselves, and much
						of the show's dialogue involves the characters arguing or yelling at one another. Despite their lack of
						success or achievements, they maintain high opinions of themselves and display an obsessive interest in
						their reputations and public images.
					</p>

					<p>
						The Gang has no sense of shame when attempting to get what they want and often engage in activities that
						others would find humiliating, disgusting, or shocking.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some of these situations include: becoming addicted to crack cocaine and pretending to be mentally
						challenged in order to qualify for welfare; attempted cannibalism; kidnapping; blackface;
